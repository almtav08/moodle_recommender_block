# Overview of this project
This is an hybrid recommender system joining together collaborative filtering and knowledge-based filtering. It is also a result of the Horizon Europe Project e-DIPLOMA (Project number: 101061424, Call: HORIZON-CL2-2021-TRANSFORMATIONS-01, Duration: 01/09/2022 – 31/08/2025). This recommender is meant to work within LMS (it has been developed using Moodle as the selected LMS). This is a moodle block that is supposed to work with the recommender system. The recommender system is a separate project that can be found in this repository: [https://github.com/almtav08/recom_server](https://github.com/almtav08/recom_server)

# How to install the block
For installing this block you will have to include it under the following url: ```path_to_your_moodle/blocks/``` wherever the moodle has been installed. After that you will have to go to the moodle site, reload, and follow the installation instructions. You have two options to configure within the block:
- The first one is the URL of the recommender system. This is the URL where the recommender system is hosted.
- The second one is the number of recommendations that you want to show in the block. This is the number of recommendations that the block will show to the user.
